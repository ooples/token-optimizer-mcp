You are an expert TypeScript error resolution planner. I have 493 TypeScript compilation errors that need to be fixed systematically using a team of AI agents.

ERROR BREAKDOWN:
- TS6133: 110 (unused variables - declared but never read)
- TS2345: 107 (type argument mismatches)
- TS2322: 59 (type assignment mismatches)
- TS2554: 43 (function argument count wrong)
- TS2362: 36 (arithmetic operand must be number)
- TS6192: 35 (all imports in declaration unused)
- TS2363: 31 (left operand must be unique symbol)
- TS2339: 24 (property does not exist on type)
- TS2551: 10 (property does not exist, did you mean...)
- TS2305: 10 (module has no exported member)
- TS2749: 6 (refers to value but used as type)
- TS2724: 4 (has no exported member, did you mean...)
- TS2365: 4 (operator cannot be applied to types)
- TS2304: 4 (cannot find name)
- TS7022: 3 (implicitly has type any)
- TS2448: 3 (block-scoped variable used before declaration)
- TS7016: 2 (could not find declaration file for module)
- TS6198: 1 (all imports unused, could use type-only import)
- TS6196: 1 (composite project requires rootDir)

TOTAL: 493 errors

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a team of 5-7 expert AI agents
2. Each agent must have a SPECIFIC goal: "Fix X errors of type Y"
3. Agents should work on independent error types to enable parallel execution
4. Each agent MUST meet or surpass their goal (not just partial progress)
5. Provide verification criteria for each agent
6. Account for dependencies (e.g., fixing unused imports might reveal other errors)

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS:
- Successfully removed 168 unused imports (reduced TS6133/TS6192 by ~50%)
- Fixed all TS2305 export errors in index files
- Fixed import paths and function signatures
- Created automated scripts for pattern-based fixes

Create a detailed execution plan with:
1. Agent team roster (5-7 agents)
2. Each agent's specific goal (X errors of type Y)
3. Order of execution (sequential vs parallel)
4. Verification command for each agent
5. Expected error count after each agent completes
6. Rollback strategy if agent fails to meet goal
