This could be confusing and should clarify the actual relationship.\n```suggestion\nReadLine() uses blocking I/O by design. This is intentional for the wrapper context,\nwhere stdin is managed by a parent process such as Claude Code (a CLI tool that may use MCP servers).\nThe stream closes when the parent process terminates, preventing indefinite hangs. Timeout mechanisms are not required as the\nwrapper lifecycle is controlled by the parent process.\n```","created_at":"2025-10-17T17:02:43Z","updated_at":"2025-10-17T17:02:44Z","html_url":"https://github.com/ooples/token-optimizer-mcp/pull/28#discussion_r2440626506","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ooples/token-optimizer-mcp/pulls/28","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/ooples/token-optimizer-mcp/pulls/comments/2440626506"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/ooples/token-optimizer-mcp/pull/28#discussion_r2440626506"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/ooples/token-optimizer-mcp/pulls/28"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ooples/token-optimizer-mcp/pulls/comments/2440626506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":387,"start_side":"RIGHT","line":null,"original_line":390,"side":"RIGHT","author_association":"NONE","original_position":160,"position":1,"subject_type":"line"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ooples/token-optimizer-mcp/pulls/comments/2440626516","pull_request_review_id":3351165517,"id":2440626516,"node_id":"PRRC_kwDOQAiyM86ReQFU","diff_hunk":"@@ -271,59 +401,106 @@ function Invoke-ClaudeCodeWrapper {\n     # Track if we're in a turn\n     $inTurn = $false\n     $lastUserMessage = \"\"\n-\n-    # Start reading from stdin (piped from claude-code)\n-    # In practice, this would wrap the actual claude-code CLI process\n-    # For now, we'll demonstrate the structure\n+    $lineBuffer = [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new()\n+    $pendingToolCall = $null\n+    $lastTokenCount = 0\n \n     try {\n-        Write-VerboseLog \"Wrapper ready - monitoring for system warnings and tool calls\"\n+        Write-VerboseLog \"Wrapper ready - real-time stream processing active\"\n \n-        # Simulated processing loop (in real usage, this would pipe claude-code stdout/stderr)\n-        # For testing purposes, we'll show the structure\n+        # Configure console encoding for proper Unicode handling\n+        [Console]::InputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8\n+        [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8\n \n+        $input = [Console]::In\n         while ($true) {\n-            # Read line from stdin (in real wrapper, this comes from claude-code)\n-            $line = Read-Host -Prompt \"Input\"\n+            $line = $input.ReadLine()\n \n-            if ($line -eq \"exit\" -or $line -eq \"quit\") {\n+            # Check for end of stream\n+            if ($null -eq $line) {\n+                Write-VerboseLog \"End of stream detected\"\n                 break\n             }\n \n+            # Add to line buffer (for context lookback)\n+            [void]$lineBuffer.Add($line)\n+            if ($lineBuffer.Count -gt 100) {\n+                $lineBuffer.RemoveAt(0)  # Keep buffer size manageable\n+            }\n+\n+            # Performance tracking\n+            $parseStartTime = Get-Date\n+\n             # Parse system warnings\n             $tokenInfo = Parse-SystemWarning -Line $line\n             if ($tokenInfo) {\n                 Write-VerboseLog \"Parsed token info: Used=$($tokenInfo.Used), Remaining=$($tokenInfo.Remaining)\"\n \n                 # Check if this is a tool call transition (tokens increased)\n                 if ($tokenInfo.Used -gt $global:SessionState.LastTokens) {\n-                    # Detect tool call (in real wrapper, we'd parse the tool name from surrounding context)\n-                    # For now, we'll prompt for demo purposes\n-                    $toolName = Read-Host -Prompt \"Tool name\"\n-\n-                    if (-not $inTurn) {\n-                        Start-Turn -UserMessagePreview $lastUserMessage\n-                        $inTurn = $true\n+                    # Detect tool call from context (ONLY when tokens increased)\n+                    $toolName = Parse-ToolCallFromContext -CurrentLine $line -PreviousLines $lineBuffer\n+\n+                    if ($toolName) {\n+                        Write-VerboseLog \"Detected tool call: $toolName\"\n+\n+                        # Start turn if not already in one\n+                        if (-not $inTurn) {\n+                            Start-Turn -UserMessagePreview $lastUserMessage\n+                            $inTurn = $true\n+                        }\n+\n+                        # Check for cached response (optional)\n+                        $cachedResponse = Get-CachedToolResponse -ToolName $toolName -ToolParams @{}\n+\n+                        if ($cachedResponse) {\n+                            # Inject cached response and skip tool execution\n+                            Inject-CachedResponse -CachedResponse $cachedResponse -ToolName $toolName\n+                            Write-VerboseLog \"Cache hit!
