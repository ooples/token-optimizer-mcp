# Gemini Code Analysis: Token Optimizer MCP Server

## Project Overview
This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides advanced token optimization tools for AI-powered development. The project uses TypeScript and integrates with Claude Code CLI.

## Core Problem Areas

### 1. Token Optimization Cache Errors
**Current Issue**: Cache operations are failing with errors like:
- "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'run')"
- Cache statistics showing 0% hit rates despite successful cache writes
- Intermittent token counting errors in cache layer

**Key Files**:
- `src/server/core/cache-engine.ts` - Main caching implementation
- `src/server/core/cache-persistence.ts` - Persistence layer
- `src/utils/token-counter.ts` - Token counting utilities
- `src/server/tools/experimental/smartMetricsView.ts` - Cache statistics display

**Questions**:
1. What is causing the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'run')" error?
2. Why is the cache hit rate showing 0% when writes appear successful?
3. Are there race conditions in the cache initialization or query execution?
4. Is the SQL query construction in cache-engine.ts robust?

### 2. Token Counting Accuracy
**Current Issue**: Token counts may be inconsistent or inaccurate across different tools.

**Key Files**:
- `src/utils/token-counter.ts` - Main token counting logic
- `src/server/tools/*` - Various tools using token counting
- `src/server/core/cache-engine.ts` - Caches token counts

**Questions**:
1. Is the token counting algorithm correctly handling all input types (strings, objects, arrays)?
2. Are there edge cases causing incorrect token counts?
3. How does the token counter handle special characters, Unicode, etc.?

### 3. MCP Server Architecture Issues
**Current Issue**: Potential architectural problems in the MCP server implementation.

**Key Files**:
- `src/server/index.ts` - Main server entry point
- `src/server/core/*` - Core server infrastructure
- `src/server/tools/*` - Tool implementations

**Questions**:
1. Are there memory leaks in long-running server processes?
2. Is error handling comprehensive across all tools?
3. Are resources (database connections, file handles) properly cleaned up?

### 4. Dependency Injection Implementation
**Current Issue**: Recent refactoring introduced dependency injection but may have issues.

**Key Files**:
- `src/server/tools/*` - All tools now use DI pattern
- `src/server/index.ts` - DI container setup

**Questions**:
1. Is the dependency injection pattern correctly implemented?
2. Are there circular dependencies?
3. Are shared resources (CacheEngine, TokenCounter) properly managed?

## Analysis Request

Please analyze the codebase focusing on these specific areas:

### Priority 1: Cache Error Root Cause
Identify the exact cause of the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'run')" error in the cache layer. Provide:
- File and line number where the error originates
- The specific code pattern causing the issue
- A recommended fix with code examples

### Priority 2: Cache Hit Rate Mystery
Explain why cache statistics show 0% hit rate despite successful writes. Provide:
- Analysis of the cache read/write flow
- Potential timing or initialization issues
- Specific code changes needed

### Priority 3: Top 5 Critical Issues
Identify the top 5 most critical issues in the codebase that could cause:
- Runtime errors
- Performance degradation
- Memory leaks
- Data corruption

For each issue, provide:
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- File and line number
- Explanation of the problem
- Recommended fix

### Priority 4: Architecture Recommendations
