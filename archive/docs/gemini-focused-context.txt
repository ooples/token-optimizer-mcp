## REQUEST
Create a comprehensive fix plan with:
1. Root cause analysis for each error type
2. Dependencies between fixes (what must be fixed first)
3. Optimal execution order
4. Specific fix patterns with before/after code
5. Agent assignments for parallel execution
6. Expected error reduction per phase

Focus on the top 5 error types (TS2305, TS2724, TS6133, TS2345, TS2307).
