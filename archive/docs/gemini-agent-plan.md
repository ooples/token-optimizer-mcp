Of course. Based on the error breakdown and your requirements, here is a detailed execution plan for a team of specialized AI agents to systematically eliminate all 493 TypeScript errors.

This plan prioritizes foundational errors, enables maximum parallelism for independent tasks, and leaves cleanup tasks for the end to prevent rework.

### Pre-Execution Setup

1.  **Create a dedicated branch:** Before starting, create a new git branch to isolate these fixes.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/typescript-error-fix
    ```
2.  **Initial Verification:** Confirm the starting error count.
    *   **Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit > initial-errors.txt`
    *   **Expected:** The file should contain exactly 493 errors.

### Agent Team Roster & Execution Plan

The team consists of 6 agents, organized into three phases.

| Phase | Agent Name | Goal | Order |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **The Architect** | Fix foundational project and type resolution errors. | Sequential |
| **2** | **The Type Guardian** | Resolve core type mismatch and assignment errors. | Parallel |
| **2** | **The Signature Specialist** | Correct all function call signature mismatches. | Parallel |
| **2** | **The Operator** | Fix all invalid arithmetic and logical operations. | Parallel |
| **2** | **The Property Master** | Resolve incorrect property access on objects. | Parallel |
| **3** | **The Janitor** | Clean up all unused code and remaining minor errors. | Sequential |

---

### **Phase 1: Foundational Fixes (Sequential)**

This phase must be completed first, as these errors can affect the entire compilation and the accuracy of other error reports.

#### **Agent 1: The Architect**
*   **Goal:** Fix 21 foundational errors.
    *   `TS2304`: 4 (Cannot find name)
    *   `TS7016`: 2 (Could not find declaration file for module)
    *   `TS6196`: 1 (Composite project requires rootDir)
    *   `TS2551`: 10 (Property does not exist, did you mean...)
    *   `TS2724`: 4 (No exported member, did you mean...)
*   **Execution Order:** Sequential (Must complete before Phase 2).
*   **Verification:**
    *   **Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
    *   **Success Criteria:** The total error count is reduced by exactly 21.
*   **Expected Error Count:** 493 - 21 = **472 errors**
*   **Rollback Strategy:** If the goal is not met, run `git reset --hard HEAD` to revert the agent's changes and analyze the remaining errors for a new approach.

---

### **Phase 2: Core Logic & Type Safety (Parallel)**

These agents can work simultaneously in separate branches, which can then be merged sequentially.

#### **Agent 2: The Type Guardian**
*   **Goal:** Fix 166 core type-mismatch errors.
    *   `TS2345`: 107 (Argument of type 'X' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Y')
    *   `TS2322`: 59 (Type 'X' is not assignable to type 'Y')
*   **Execution Order:** Parallel.
*   **Verification:**
    *   **Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
    *   **Success Criteria:** The total error count is reduced by exactly 166 from the post-Phase 1 total.
*   **Expected Error Count:** 472 - 166 = **306 errors**
*   **Rollback Strategy:** `git reset --hard HEAD`. These errors are complex; failure may require breaking the goal into smaller, file-specific tasks.

#### **Agent 3: The Signature Specialist**
*   **Goal:** Fix 43 function argument count errors.
    *   `TS2554`: 43 (Expected X arguments, but got Y)
*   **Execution Order:** Parallel.
*   **Verification:**
    *   **Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
    *   **Success Criteria:** The total error count is reduced by exactly 43.
*   **Expected Error Count:** 306 - 43 = **263 errors**
*   **Rollback Strategy:** `git reset --hard HEAD`.

#### **Agent 4: The Operator**
*   **Goal:** Fix 71 invalid operation errors.
    *   `TS2362`: 36 (Operand of an arithmetic operation must be type 'number'...)
    *   `TS2363`: 31 (The left-hand side of a 'for...in' statement must be of type 'string' or 'any')
    *   `TS2365`: 4 (Operator 'X' cannot be applied to types 'Y' and 'Z')
*   **Execution Order:** Parallel.
*   **Verification:**
    *   **Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
    *   **Success Criteria:** The total error count is reduced by exactly 71.
*   **Expected Error Count:** 263 - 71 = **192 errors**
*   **Rollback Strategy:** `git reset --hard HEAD`.

#### **Agent 5: The Property Master**
*   **Goal:** Fix 24 property access errors.
    *   `TS2339`: 24 (Property 'X' does not exist on type 'Y')
*   **Execution Order:** Parallel.
*   **Verification:**
    *   **Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
    *   **Success Criteria:** The total error count is reduced by exactly 24.
*   **Expected Error Count:** 192 - 24 = **168 errors**
*   **Rollback Strategy:** `git reset --hard HEAD`.

---

### **Phase 3: Final Cleanup (Sequential)**

This final agent runs after all other fixes are merged. It handles cleanup, which could have been affected by the previous fixes (e.g., a variable is no longer unused).

#### **Agent 6: The Janitor**
*   **Goal:** Fix the remaining 168 errors.
    *   `TS6133`: 110 (unused variables)
    *   `TS6192`: 35 (all imports in declaration unused)
    *   `TS2305`: 10 (module has no exported member - *Note: These may have been introduced by other fixes*)
    *   `TS2749`: 6 (refers to a value but is being used as a type)
    *   `TS7022`: 3 (implicitly has type 'any')
    *   `TS2448`: 3 (block-scoped variable used before declaration)
    *   `TS6198`: 1 (all imports unused, could use type-only import)
*   **Execution Order:** Sequential (Must run last).
*   **Verification:**
    *   **Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
    *   **Success Criteria:** The command executes without any output.
*   **Expected Error Count:** 168 - 168 = **0 errors**
*   **Rollback Strategy:** `git reset --hard HEAD`. If this agent fails, it's likely due to cascading changes. The remaining errors should be analyzed manually and potentially assigned to a new, highly specialized agent.

This structured plan provides a clear path to a zero-error state while maximizing efficiency through parallel work.
