I have a TypeScript project with 811 compilation errors. I need you to analyze the error patterns and create a ROCK-SOLID fix plan.

ERROR BREAKDOWN:
278 TS6133 - Declared but never used
248 TS2305 - Module has no exported member
85 TS2345 - Argument type not assignable
47 TS2307 - Cannot find module
34 TS6192 - All imports are unused
22 TS2554 - Expected X arguments but got Y
19 TS2339 - Property does not exist on type
16 TS2322 - Type not assignable
15 TS2724 - Module has no exported member (with suggestion)
10 TS2551 - Property does not exist (typo)

SAMPLE ERRORS ATTACHED IN build-errors-full.txt

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze the root causes (not just symptoms)
2. Identify error dependencies (what MUST be fixed first)
3. Create optimal fix order to minimize cascading effects
4. Provide specific fix patterns with before/after code
5. Design parallel agent team assignments
6. Estimate error reduction per phase

CRITICAL: I will use your plan to coordinate expert AI agents. Make it specific, actionable, and foolproof.
