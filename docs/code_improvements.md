### **User Story: Establish Code Quality and Formatting Standards**

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want an automated linting and code formatting pipeline set up for the project, so that all code adheres to a consistent style and quality standard, making it easier to read, maintain, and debug.

**Description:**
The project currently lacks any tooling for enforcing code quality or a consistent style. To improve maintainability and developer collaboration, this user story proposes setting up ESLint (for identifying problematic patterns) and Prettier (for automatic code formatting).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   **ESLint** and **Prettier** are added to the project's `devDependencies`.
*   Configuration files (`.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc`) are created in the project root.
*   ESLint is configured with the recommended rules for TypeScript (`@typescript-eslint/recommended`).
*   Prettier is configured to work with ESLint without conflicts (using `eslint-config-prettier`).
*   New scripts are added to `package.json`:
    *   `"lint"`: To run ESLint on the entire `src` directory.
    *   `"format"`: To run Prettier to format the entire `src` directory.
*   All existing code in the `src` directory is made to pass the new linting and formatting rules.

**Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Install Dependencies:** Add `eslint`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `prettier`, and `eslint-config-prettier` to `devDependencies` and run `npm install`.
2.  **Configure ESLint:** Create a `.eslintrc.js` file that extends the recommended TypeScript and Prettier configurations.
3.  **Configure Prettier:** Create a `.prettierrc` file with some basic style rules (e.g., `tabWidth`, `singleQuote`).
4.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the `lint` and `format` scripts.
5.  **Apply Fixes:** Run `npm run format` and `npm run lint -- --fix` to bring the existing codebase into compliance with the new standards.

### **User Story: Remove Unused Code and Imports**

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want to remove all unused variables and imports from the codebase so that the project is cleaner, easier to navigate, and free of dead code.

**Description:**
The build process reports many `TS6133` (unused variable) and `TS6192` (unused import) errors. This dead code clutters the codebase, makes it harder to understand, and can sometimes hide other issues. Removing it is a necessary step to improve the overall quality and maintainability of the project.

**Example Error:**
`error TS6133: 'CacheEngine' is declared but its value is never read.`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   All unused local variables and function parameters are removed.
*   All unused `import` statements are removed.
*   The project build log is clean of `TS6133` and `TS6192` errors.

**Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Run Build:** Execute `npm run build` and save the complete list of `TS6133` and `TS6192` errors.
2.  **Iterate and Remove:** Go through each reported file and line number.
3.  **Delete Unused Code:** Safely delete the unused variable declaration or the entire unused `import` statement.
4.  **Verify:** Periodically re-run the build during the process to ensure that removing code does not introduce new errors.
