# Token Optimization & Cache Analysis

## Question 1: Token Optimization Issue

The token-optimizer-mcp project claims 50-70% token reduction but tests show tokens INCREASE:

- Small text: 10 → 35 tokens (-250% FAIL)
- Medium: 60 → 142 tokens (-136% FAIL)
- Code: 114 → 211 tokens (-85% FAIL)
- Only extreme repetitive: 501 → 34 tokens (+93% SUCCESS)

Current flow:
1. Compress with Brotli ✅
2. Encode as base64 (adds 33% overhead) ❌
3. Count tokens on base64 string ❌

**Is this hypothesis correct? What's the right approach for token savings with caching?**

## Question 2: Cache Implementation Review

Analyze `src/core/cache-engine.ts`, `src/core/compression-engine.ts`, and `src/core/token-counter.ts` for:

1. Race conditions in cache operations
2. Thread safety with SQLite
3. Memory leaks in LRU cache
4. Data corruption risks
5. Decompression errors
